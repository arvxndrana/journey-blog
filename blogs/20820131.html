<p>I am bored.</p>
<p>I just want to live a normal life. Right now, I am listening to lofi
song, watching pointless videos in YouTube. I want to do a lot of
things. I have a lot of dreams that I want to achieve. I want to become
a better person.. But, The anxiety, depression and porn addiction are
not letting me. I have watched every trending hentai of the top hentai
website upto the fifth page. I have spent more time on porn than,
reading actual books in my entire life. I have only completed reading 3
books so far. Ya, I have started many books but, never read all of the
content because of my short attention span. I have never completed a
task successfully in my life. I have never done any homework or,
assignment in time, ever.</p>
<p>I sound pathetic. I am pathetic. But, mostly I am lonely.</p>
<p>I want to be something, achieve something. I haven't achieved
anything in the real world. I can't even sleep properly.</p>
<p>I want to become a YouTuber with a small following that follows my
journey of self improvement. I want to learn cybersecurity. I want to
have muscle and not be called “thin”. I want to hang out with my friends
without having to worry about gay sexual thoughts. I want to be able to
have long term relationships with the people I am close to and this does
not only include my love interest. I want to experience new things,
write about my interest and socialize with people around me.</p>
<p>I want to get out the social media hell, the hell created and
controlled by algorithm. The lustful sight of a girl's big boobs is seen
everywhere in my YouTube's homepage, Reddit, everywhere I go in the
digital world really.</p>
<p>The music I listen to one time, just keeps on playing in my mind
forever, so much so, that I can't even listen to music normally anymore,
The echo in my head keeps on playing the same music over and over and
over again.</p>
<p>I know how to speak English but, not the Grammar. I know how to speak
Nepali but, not the Byakaran as well as Writing. I can't even speak my
own language which is Rana Tharu properly. I am a shame to my culture,
to my country, to my parents, to my friends, to my teachers and to
myself.</p>
<p>I score above average in school exams but, cannot even explain the
most basic things to others like “The Internet”. What am I even doing
with my life.</p>
<p>Right now, I figured out how to connect a domain to a repository but,
I don't think that I can teach this to others because As said earlier, I
am not good at explaining things.</p>
<p>What is the point of learning, if you cannot explain the thing that
you are learning to others? and What is the point of explaining if you
cannot accurately put down facts?</p>
<p>I have a short term memory loss probably because of too much
masturbation, spending time online watching brainrot content etc. I
forget basic things like what I ate in the morning, what day is today,
why am i here etc.</p>
<p>All the above have a solution. A solution that is simple but, not
easy. A solution of what is called delayed gratification which means
doing things for the long term benefit instead of short term
satisfaction. So, I have throughly made a list of things I want to do
physically, mentally and psychologically, what I want to achieve, what I
want to read etc. below. These are in no particular order, these will
not be perfect but, is going to be a starting point for something. Keep
in mind that I have been trying this self help journey from class 8, now
I am in class 11 (technically 12), so, at the age of 13.</p>
<p>I have had few success in the past like sleeping in time, reading,
studying for ~8 hours, not watching porn for ~6 months. But, those were
for short term gains. I want to do something long term. So here is the
list of things that I want to achieve in no particular order and in no
particular level of urgency:</p>
