<h1>NTR is just like Porn Addiction</h1>
<p>NTR is just like Porn Addiction. I like to think of NTR just as a porn addiction because of the similarities between them. NTR, for those of you that don't know, stands for &quot;Netorare&quot; which means cheating in Japanese, well sort of. NTR refers to the genre of hentai and manga/doujinshi in which a love interest of a character in a story has sex with a person outside of their love interest, which in most cases, is males getting cheated on. But, if the female is the one getting cheated on then it is called &quot;Netori&quot;. I use the word &quot;cheating&quot; but, NTR is worse than cheating (which i read somewhere but, you are the judge), Since, cheating means having sex with another person only once (maybe, idk) but, NTR has the culprit having sex multiple times, even going as far as to abandoning the relationship that they previously had completely and indulging in the hedonistic lifestyle.</p>
<p>As it is obvious by now, I like NTR. I hated NTR in the past but, I like it nowadays (Well, that is a lie because in the past when I was a serious Porn Addict which I still am, So, I didn't care about the story in any way and just wanted to fap and get over with). I like it because one of the character in Call of the Night (The vampire girl) likes it. I like it because it feels miserable. I like it because I don't have a girlfriend, yet. I like it because it feels the same for me with my porn addiction.</p>
<p>In most NTR, The story doesn't make any sense. In some cases it isn't even a NTR but, just a character liking another character but, not the other way around, which believe it or not happens a lot often in the real world (maybe, idk). Now, NTR is just like porn addiction, I say this because I have been masturbating since I found out that I could shoot white stuff out of my penis (i.e at the age of 12). I knew about Porn and Sex even before that at the age of 8. I was fantasizing about a LOT of fucked up things even before I was of the age of producing semen in my body. I am 17 now, So, you could say that I know alot about this shit as much as I like to hate it (weird choice of words but, ok).</p>
<p>Well, it is exactly the thing that can be seen in NTR hentai. I don't know about the manga world but, in hentai, There are a LOT of NTR hentai (There are even more Incest but, that is the topic for another time). But, The problem is that NTR hentais have one of the best animation in the whole world (Sharing its place with Ugly Bastard, but fuck you Ugly Bastards). I saw in a reddit comment that it is &quot;The Universal Law of Balance&quot; or something, that the more fucked up the hentai is, the better the animation is going to be.</p>
<p>What I hate about NTR hentais tho is that, it doesn't make sense. Some innocent girl has a really dumb idea of doing something creepy like obeying command of a really creepy dude that they know have bad intention, for the sake of their love interest. The creepy dude then tries to manipulate the girl by doing his creepy things and the girl just accepts it, like WHAT?!??! NANI!!??. The girl then tries to cope with the creepy dude's behaviour with batshit crazy statements like &quot;It is for the sake of my love-interest-kun!&quot;, &quot;I have to endure this for the sake of my love-interest-kun&quot; or, &quot;I will end this quickly and go back to my life before&quot;. Like do they even have common sense? They can just report the creepy dude to the police or some higher authorities or something but, no &quot;I need to suck his cock and fulfill his desires so that he will let me go quickly&quot; (the level of copium) and they fall in love with the creepy dude's gigantic penis and the creepy dude's ability to make them feel like a woman so much so that they abandon everything and start saying things like &quot;I don't care anymore&quot;, &quot;I want this more&quot; and soon the hentai turns in favor of the creepy dude while the girl's love interest cries in tears or sometimes doesn't even know about this relationships. And the girl then leaves the love-interest of her life for seeking pleasure in someone else's penis. Most NTR hentais have bad ending but, some have good ending like the boy getting cucked gets in a position he wants or, he gets another nice girl. Some have horrible ending with the boy getting depressed and shit. One hentai had the boy getting cucked turn gay (lol but, I feel bad for that guy).</p>
<p>Now, I tell you this to make a point. The point is that, aren't we, the porn addicts, the same as the girl. The girl, who chooses the path of pleasure instead of a perfect relationship. I mean we can spend our precious time in many positive things like making someone happy, focusing in our studies, helping in the development of our society and a better world (and we know that), but, instead we like to spend countless hours masturbating, jerking off, fapping to porn, hentai, manga, doujinshi etc. What is the difference between the girl that chooses to cuck her lover, or husband or whatever for pleasure and us that choose to abandon our hobbies, goals, relationships (friends and families) for pleasure. Aren't we on the same boat? Don't we feel the same guilt that the girl feels cucking her boyfriend when we choose to spend countless hours to jerk off to a fucking moving cartoons and pixels?</p>
<p>Here, The boy getting cucked is a metaphor of our precious time, our hobbies, our goals, our relationships, that cares for us, that wants us to succeed, that provides us with love, The girl cucking is a metaphor of our feelings, our guilt, our desires to have a happy life but, failing to do so because of a certain creepy dude, that is, the fucking porn. As much as you hate to be with the creepy dude in the first place because you had a good relation with your love-interest, <b>YOU ARE DOOMED IF YOU START DOING THE THINGS HE WANTS YOU TO DO AND FALL IN THE CYCLE OF DESPAIR WHICH YOU MAY NEVER RECOVER FROM.</b></p>
<p>Even if you say that you only watch the good porn, you are still doomed because the thing is, porn is designed to be destructive, you cannot escape from it unless you really, really, really, really, really try it <a href="https://easypeasymethod.org/">(Read &quot;EasyPeasyMethod&quot; Book by Hackauthor for ways to escape from this hell.)</a></p>
<p>That being said, I am a hypocrite and as said previously I like NTR and will still be liking them until I don't feel like it anymore (which happens alot in my hobbies and academic progress so what is this NTR thing infront of them). And November is coming so, I am preparing for NNN Challenge.</p>
<p>Hope that you feel a sense of relief reading this (not that kind) and agree with my views. Ya this feels like r/im14andthisisdeep because I am a fucking idiot but, I wanted to get this feeling off my chest for so long and also improve my writing skills (which as you can see, is terrible). As I said previously, I hated NTR and started liking it for this reason and more. I like some NTR but, I don't like others which doesn't make any logical sense, even to me. I used to hate it with passion but, the porn addiction is so strong that anything goes with me nowadays, I hope I recover as I have plenty of goals and a bright future So, I cannot waste my time on this porn thing. I also wanted to show others that I don't care about this stuff even if it hurts others, but as you can see, this NTR shit also hurts alot to me which I think is wired to our human brain when sympathizing with betrayal. I know betrayal hurts peoples and it especially hurts me even if I claim that I don't care about it. I liked the Mr. Robot's character Leon's view on kinky stuff. He says that he doesn't judge people based on their preference in porn, which I try to follow (I will judge if you like pedophilia tho, fuck you if you like pedophilia). Even if you like NTR stuff, it is nothing to be ashamed of as long as it is in fiction. <b>DON'T YOU TRY FUCKING NTR STUFF IN REAL LIFE YOU FUCKING PSYCHOPATH (OR SOCIOPATH IDK).</b></p>
<p>I like dark shit and I found NTR to be right in my alley. I know I am going to get over it sooner or later and hope you do the same too with the things that bother you in your life. I hope you have a good life in the near future and not end up succumbing to pleasure just like the girl in a NTR hentai.</p>
<p>Again, have a nice day (Future me).</p>
